# Let's practice git!
The purpose of this repository is to practice git workflows within a "safe space". This is a great place to learn/practice git fundementals, or test out something with zero stakes before executing on a meaningful project. Don't worry about potentially messing something up, a big apart of learning git is making mistakces and then fixing them! 

## Guidelines 
* This is a **public repo**, so do not put anything here that shouldn't be widely shared!
* If you want to experiment, try to [make a new branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) first and limit size and amount of files and/or use subfolders to keep the repo relatively clean-ish
